#### Accessibility Notes
___

###### The more we use semantic elements, the better, because it is good for accessibility

###### Follow header hierarhy as we go to different spots within out page

###### Even if we are not showing the header on the page, we should create it, so that screen readers can follow them, cause it is very common to navigate the header using a screen reader

###### We can user aria-hidden="true" atribute on elements we don't need to be visible to a screen readers

###### For button elements that we don't want to take place of an actual button, and being pressed on enter before the actual button, we create them with DIV element, giving it a role="button" and a tabindex="0" since it will not have it by default, like an actual button element
